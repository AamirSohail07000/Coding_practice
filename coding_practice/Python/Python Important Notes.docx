*args in Python
In Python, *args is used in function definitions to allow the function to accept a variable number of positional arguments. It collects all the extra arguments passed to the function into a tuple.

How *args Works
The * before args tells Python that the function can accept multiple arguments.
The arguments passed to *args are stored in a tuple.
You can iterate over *args using a loop.
Example 1: Using *args to Handle Multiple Arguments
python
Copy
Edit
def add_numbers(*args):
    return sum(args)  # args is a tuple of all passed numbers

print(add_numbers(1, 2, 3, 4))  # Output: 10
print(add_numbers(5, 10))       # Output: 15
âœ… Here, add_numbers can take any number of arguments.

Example 2: Mixing *args with Regular Parameters
python
Copy
Edit
def greet(name, *messages):
    print(f"Hello, {name}!")
    for msg in messages:
        print(msg)

greet("Alice", "Good morning!", "How are you?", "Have a great day!")
Output:

Edit
Hello, Alice!
Good morning!
How are you?
Have a great day!
âœ… The first argument is assigned to name, and the rest go into *messages.

Example 3: Unpacking a List or Tuple into *args
python
Copy
Edit
def multiply(*args):
    result = 1
    for num in args:
        result *= num
    return result

numbers = (2, 3, 4)
print(multiply(*numbers))  # Output: 24
âœ… Here, *numbers unpacks the tuple elements into separate arguments.

Key Points About *args
It collects extra positional arguments into a tuple.
It allows functions to accept an unknown number of arguments.
You can mix *args with other parameters, but *args must come after regular parameters.
You can unpack sequences (lists, tuples) into *args using *.
When to Use *args?
âœ” When writing functions that need to accept a flexible number of arguments.
âœ” When passing multiple values dynamically without defining multiple parameters.

ðŸ’¡ Comparison with **kwargs (for keyword arguments)
If *args is for positional arguments, **kwargs is for keyword arguments (key-value pairs).
