Definitions and Examples for Class, Object, Method, and Function in Python
1. Class:
A class is a blueprint for creating objects. It defines properties (attributes) and behaviors (methods) that the objects will have.

ðŸ”¹ Example of a Class:

python
Copy
Edit
class Car:
    def __init__(self, brand, model):
        self.brand = brand
        self.model = model
    
    def display_info(self):
        print(f"Car: {self.brand} {self.model}")
Here, Car is a class that has attributes (brand and model) and a method (display_info).

2. Object:
An object is an instance of a class. It represents a specific entity created based on the class.

ðŸ”¹ Example of an Object:

python
Copy
Edit
my_car = Car("Toyota", "Corolla")  # Creating an object of class Car
my_car.display_info()
Output:

makefile
Copy
Edit
Car: Toyota Corolla
Here, my_car is an object of the Car class.

3. Method:
A method is a function that is defined inside a class and operates on the objects of that class.

ðŸ”¹ Example of a Method:

python
Copy
Edit
class Person:
    def __init__(self, name, age):
        self.name = name
        self.age = age
    
    def greet(self):  # This is a method
        print(f"Hello, my name is {self.name} and I am {self.age} years old.")
Here, greet() is a method because it is defined inside the Person class and uses self to access instance attributes.

4. Function:
A function is a reusable block of code that performs a specific task. It is defined using the def keyword but is not inside a class.

ðŸ”¹ Example of a Function:

python
Copy
Edit
def add_numbers(a, b):
    return a + b

result = add_numbers(5, 3)
print("Sum:", result)
Output:

makefile
Copy
Edit
Sum: 8
Here, add_numbers() is a function because it is not inside a class.

5. Difference Between Function and Method:
Feature	          Function	        Method
Defined Inside	  Outside a class	  Inside a class
Requires self	    No	              Yes
Called Using	    Function name	    Object name
Example	          add_numbers(5, 3)	my_car.display_info()
Summary:
Class â†’ Blueprint (e.g., Car)
Object â†’ Instance of a class (e.g., my_car = Car("Toyota", "Corolla"))
Method â†’ Function inside a class (e.g., display_info())
Function â†’ Independent block of reusable code (e.g., add_numbers())
