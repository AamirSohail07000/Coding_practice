Exercise 4 Joins
Consider the following database of student enrollment in courses &
books adopted for each course:
STUDENT (regno: string, name: string, major: string, bdate:date)
COURSE (course #:int, cname:string, dept:string)
ENROLL ( regno:string, course#:int, sem:int, marks:int)
BOOK _ ADOPTION (course# :int, sem:int, book-ISBN:int)
TEXT (book-ISBN:int, book-title:string, publisher:string,
author:string)
Demonstrate with appropriate SQL Statement for the following:
1. Create the above tables by properly specifying the primary keys
and the foreign keys.
2. Enter at least five tuples for each relation.
3. Demonstrate how you add a new text book to the database and
make this book be adopted by some department.
4. List the students who have been enrolled.
5. List the students who have registered but not enrolled.
6. List the books which have been adopted.
7. List any department that has all its adopted books published by a
specific publisher.
8. Illustrate inner join, Left join, right join, full join by joining
STUDENT and ENROLL table.
Objective:
The objective of this exercise is to enable you to understand and use SQL
relational concepts along with the concepts of Joins.
