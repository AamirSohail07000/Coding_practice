Exercise 5 View, Union
Consider the following tables maintained by a book dealer:
AUTHOR (author-id:int, name:string, city:string, country:string)
PUBLISHER (publisher-id:int, name:string, city:string,
country:string)
CATALOG (book-id:int, title:string, author-id:int, publisher-id:int,
category-id:int, year:int, price:int)
CATEGORY (category-id:int, description:string)
ORDER-DETAILS (order-no:int, book-id:int, quantity:int)
Demonstrate with appropriate SQL Statement for the following:
1. Create the above tables by properly specifying the primary keys
and the foreign keys.
2. Enter at least five tuples for each relation.
3. Give the details of the authors who have 2 or more books in the
catalog and the price of the books is greater than the average price
of the books in the catalog and the year of publication is after
certain year (say 2000).
4. Find the author of the book which has maximum sales.
5. Demonstrate how you increase the price of books published by a
specific publisher by 10%.
6. Illustrate the use of UNION operator between the table AUTHOR
and CATALOG table.
Objective: The objective of this exercise is to enable you to understand
Transaction processing and create VIEW. Its objective is also to get the
concept of UNION operator.
