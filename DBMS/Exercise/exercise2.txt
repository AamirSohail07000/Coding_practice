--------Question------


Consider the database given below.
Supplier (scode: int, sname: string, scity: string, turnover: int)
Part (pcode: string, weight: int, color: string, cost: int,
sellingprice: int)
Supplier_Part (scode: int, pcode: string, qty: int)
Demonstrate with appropriate SQL Statement for the following:
1. Create the above tables
2. Insert at least five suitable tuples for each relation
3. Get the supplier number and part number in ascending order of
supplier number.
4. Get the details of supplier who operate from certain place (say
Kolkata) with turnover 50.

supplier 5.
15. Get the part number for the part supplied by more than one
supplier.
