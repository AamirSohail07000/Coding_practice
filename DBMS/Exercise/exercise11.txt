Create a trigger to update the 'product_price_history' table when the
price of the product is updated in the 'product' table to maintain the
history of the prices of the products when the price of a product
changes constantly.
Objective: The objective of this exercise is to enable you to use trigger in
PL/SQL

Create the PRODUCT Table
CREATE TABLE PRODUCT (
    product_id NUMBER PRIMARY KEY,
    product_name VARCHAR2(100),
    price NUMBER
);

Create the PRODUCT_PRICE_HISTORY Table

CREATE TABLE PRODUCT_PRICE_HISTORY (
    history_id NUMBER GENERATED ALWAYS AS IDENTITY PRIMARY KEY,
    product_id NUMBER,
    old_price NUMBER,
    new_price NUMBER,
    updated_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    CONSTRAINT fk_product FOREIGN KEY (product_id) REFERENCES PRODUCT(product_id)
);
